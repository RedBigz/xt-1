# 2025-07-15 - Research

I've been researching today about 3D printer parts and brainstorming all the logistics behind this modular system.

**Estimated time:** 4 hours

## Designing Factors

- I want my printer to be easily user-repairable without any issues (taking inspiration from Framework devices)
- Single/two common screw heads used throughout the build (I'm thinking of Torx T10 or T5)
- _Attempting_ to do a heated bed
- Controlled via a socketed Pi CM3/CM4 (Klipper)
- SUPER EASY TO DISASSEMBLE!
- A triple module bay on the toolhead which can be hotswapped while the printer is on (for e.g. filament sensor, RGB, resonance tester, camera, laser cutter :3), using pogo pins and a dovetail system

## Part Ideas

### Base

- As suggested by Evan Le, I'm going with 2020 T-shape Aluminium Extrusions
- MGN12H or MGN9H rails
- CoreXY gantry

## Electronics Ideas

### Internals

- Socketed Pi CM3/CM4 on a custom daughterboard
- Socketed RP2040-based (custom?) motherboard
- TMC2209 Steppers
- Mean Well LRS-350-24 PSU

### Toolhead

- CR-Touch
- Lancer Melt Zone Long Hotend
- Nema 17 Steppers
- 3 Dovetail Bays for fans & expansions

## On Pi Compute Modules

For designing a motherboard with the Pi 4, I'll need to solder Hirose `DF40C-100DS-0.4v` connectors, which are SMD.

## Designing the PCB (and failing)

I got about this much done in terms of an Ethernet connection (MagJack) before calling quits. **I'm now deciding to run a regular Raspberry Pi 4 and use a stock motherboard such as the BTT SKR MINI.**

## The Dovetail Plug system
(also known as the tail plug system ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬, i'll be shortening it to t-plug from here on out)

<br>
Here is the system for swappable toolhead attachments. I've decided on these main points:
- The CR-Touch will NOT use the attachment system as it requires multiple grounds and for the Z stepper to be on the same MCU (not happening)
- The 5V and 24V PWM inputs will be turned on as soon as both **CONT** pins are connected (in the event of a connection)
- One UART bus will be connected for the center module (the Pi Pico only has two UART buses and one needs to be used to connect to the Linux Pi)

I took the time to figure out KiCad and make the necessary symbols and footprints for the t-plug.

Here is the female PCB, using a JST-PH to communicate with the extruder board:

# 2025-07-18 - CAD Designing and fixes

**Estimated time:** 6 hours

## Plug Design

i've got the thing in OnShape now, and designed a dovetail system for keeping the pogo pins in place.

## Base Design

## Fixes

### Shorting avoidance on the T-plug

![fixed t-plug schematic](img/2025/07/18/fixed_tplug.png)

I moved ground away from the powered pads to avoid pogo pins shorting due to proximity when sliding. I also changed the pad size of the female receptacle to avoid such proximity (as the pins are 0.9mm and the gap was 0.5mm):

# 2025-07-19 - Toolhead

**Estimated time:** 7 hours

I'm pretty tired so I'll cut to the chase here. I made about 70% of the toolhead, and the only things left are the electronics and fans.
